# journal-prompter
I created this repo during my study at Dev Academy to practice using React, Redux and Chakra UI.

# Set up notes

```
npm install
git checkout -b <branchname>
npm run dev
```

To keep out of trouble:
- When running knex, run `npm run knex <command>`, e.g. `npm run knex migrate:latest` rather than using `npx`
- When running webpack, run `npm run webpack <extra commands>`, e.g. `npm run webpack`, rather than using `npx`
- This repo is set up for SCSS (aka "sass" style CSS). To avoid getting into a "why is my CSS not working" trap you'll need to make your CSS changes in /client/styles/index.scss and NOT in /server/public/styles.css
